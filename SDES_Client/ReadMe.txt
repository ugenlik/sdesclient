Aim of the Project:
To develop implementations of SDES encryption and decryption,  Together the our team develop two GUIs that  allow the exchange of encrypted messages and the subsequent decryption and display of those messages. The GUIs  are developed in Java and Python tied to the SDES implementations using the Java Native Interface (JNI). The GUI allow the user to enter the key to be used, a text message to be sent, and see any received, decrypted messages

Instructions:

Open Terminal and find the directory of "server.py" and "client.py" then  run following commands

"python server.py"
"python client.py"

Above terminal commands allows Java Client to connect python server. While python server is running run the Java Client and Connect a desired common port, set the 10 digit binary key on both python and java GUI.
